Youko Hatta (born Youko Sugiyama), who had previously studied under Osamu Tezuka as an artist at Mushi Production, founded the company with her husband, Hideaki Hatta, in 1981. Kyoto Animation spent its early years doing finishing work for other companies' productions, but opened its own drawing department in 1986, the year following its establishment as a limited company. \n\nBy the mid-90s, the company had developed a strong reputation in the industry, as well as ties to studios such as Gonzo, Shin-Ei Animation, and Sunrise. Kyoto Animation released its first full in-house production—the first Munto OVA—in March 2003, and its first television anime, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, in the summer of the same year. \n\nThe company gained worldwide attention on July 18, 2019 when an arson attack destroyed its original studio (known as Studio 1) in Fushimi, claiming the lives of 36 people.",

It employs 360 people as of April 2023 between its Tokyo and Sendai studios. Maruyama's intent was for the film Kono Sekai no Katasumi ni (In This Corner of the World) to be the studio's first release, though the project would not be complete until 2016. By that time, the studio had already co-produced Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope) and Hajime no Ippo: Rising, and released its first original anime—Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance). \n\nThe name MAPPA is an acronym for Maruyama Animation Produce Project Association. Maruyama stepped down as president in 2016 to form Studio M2. He was replaced by former Studio 4°C employee Manabu Ootsuka.",

Television adaptations of Trigun and Clamp's Cardcaptor Sakura in 1998 were hits domestically and later aired overseas, and the same year director Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue was released as his first of four critically-acclaimed films with the company. \n\nMadhouse remained successful throughout the 2000s and 2010s, adding director Mamoru Hosoda to its roster and releasing numerous popular television anime, including adaptations of Hajime no Ippo, Death Note, and One Punch Man.

Hikaru Kondou—a former production assistant at Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment) and Telecom Animation Film and producer at Step Eizou—founded the studio in October 2000. The company's name originates from a UFO-shaped table Kondou came across as he was devising the studio's vision. He subsequently acquired the table and named the studio after it. \n\nAt the time of establishment, the studio primarily produced adaptations of novel, manga, and original projects by ASCII Media Works (now Kadokawa), most of which featured wacky comedy and eccentric developments. Following the release of the Kara no Kyoukai (The Garden of Sinners) film series, ufotable came into the spotlight. \n\nContrary to popular belief, the quality of ufotable shows is due to their unusual degree of production independence, in-house talent, and exceptional organization, rather than having vastly higher budgets than other animation studios. \n\nAs of February 2023, the company employs about 240 full-time staff between its Suginami and Tokushima studios, the latter of which was established in April 2009.",

        'A Japanese animation planning and production company. "PA" is an abbreviation for "Progressive Animation".\n\nOn November 10, 2000, Kenji Horikawa, the company representative and producer of BEE TRAIN, established Etsuchu Animation Honpo Co., Ltd. in Jobata-cho, Higashi-Tonami-gun, Toyama Prefecture. On January 1, 2002, the company officially changed its name to PA Works (PA Works Co., Ltd.), and immediately moved the studio to its current location. The reason for its establishment is that Horikawa needs to return to the local area according to the family\'s agreement, and seeing that there is no mature animation studio in the local area, he decided to start a business. At the beginning of its establishment, due to limited funds, it was necessary to borrow an abandoned hospital for reconstruction, and to borrow the cable TV network to handle various administrative work. Since its establishment, the company has long been one of the cooperative partners of BEE TRAIN, Production IG and BONES.\nWith the development of the company\'s business, the company has not only established a branch in the capital, Tokyo, but also committed to improving the health and dormitory welfare of employees. At present, Toyama Head Office is mainly responsible for painting and 3D-CG production, while Tokyo office P-10 is responsible for performance and distribution production. In 2008, the company invested in the independent production of "true tears" for the first time, and used this to set a route for its early promotion of original animation and to maintain the high quality of the finished product. At the same time, the company also invested in the production of Q-style prints of "Professor Layton Series". As for the future outlook, the president has expressed the hope that one day he will be able to independently produce two films a year on average, with a total of more than 50 episodes of animation production throughout the year.',

        "AIC (Anime International Company, Inc.) is a Japanese animation studio based in Nerima, Tokyo, Japan. Kazushi Nomura and Toru Miura established AIC on July 15, 1982, with Nomura serving as the studio's president until leaving to found Another Push Pin Planning (APPP) on June 22, 1984. Following Nomura's departure, Miura assumed the role as the studio's president. As a result, the studio began producing works as a prime contractor, riding on the late 1980s OVA boom. The studio later expanded into game production (AIC Spirits) and the publishing business (AIC Club). In 2003, the studio shuttered AIC Spirits and AIC Club and reorganized itself into three sub-studios; AIC A.S.T.A. (now AIC ASTA), AIC Digital, and AIC Spirits. In February 2008, ACA-managed investment fund MCP Synergy acquired a 95% stake in the studio, and a new Anime International Company, Inc. was established through an incorporation-type demerger in May of the same year. In September 2010, Oizumi Corporation made AIC into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In March of the following year, the studio became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aplix Corporation. In January 2014, Aplix IP Holdings (now Aplix Corporation) announced its exit from its multimedia entertainment business, and transferred all of its shares in the studio to Toru Miura. In August 2015, the studio's animation production department was disbanded. The same year in December, Miura appointed Yasutaka Omura as the company's new representative director, and also transferred its classic IPs to AIC RIGHTS (AIC RIGHTS Co., Ltd.) through a corporation-separation procedure. In January 2020, Miura reassumed the representative director position from Omura.\n\nThe studio had several sub-studios within itself; in 2013, they consisted of: AIC ASTA, AIC Build, AIC Classic, AIC Digital, AIC PLUS+, and AIC Frontier. In addition, the studio also had a background art, CG, photography, finishing, and editing departments, as well as a recording and editing studio AIC Eastside Studio.",
